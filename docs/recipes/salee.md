# A Hardy Mountain Tart from my home valley - La Salée de la Vallée

From under the Dents du Midi lies a small valley with a strong identity. Separated from the rest of the Valais by the narrow passage of Saint-Maurice, le Val d'Illiez and Monthey have grown their own customs, culture and accent. And from there came this hardy tart, from a time where a bit of cinnamon was the luxury you would bring out on special occasions. Between the wars, the inhabitants of Monthey would take the train to enjoy it in the different bakeries. It was also a typical Christmas Eve dessert, with mulled wine and chestnuts.  
This "Salée" (which is a termed used for both sweet and savoury desserts in Romandy) also known as *lindena* in patois is a really filling, but wholesome tart. I do not recommend more than a slice at the time. But it is hard to stop.

### Ingredients: 
- Dough:
	- 300 g flour
    - 140 g butter, softened
    - 30 g sugar
    - 5g tsp salt (1 tsp)
    - 1 citron zest
    - 1 egg
    - 100g warm milk (1dl)
    - 10 g baker’s yeast
- Shortbread mix:
    - 250 g flour
    - 150 g sugar
    - 15 g ground cinnamon
    - 100 g butter, diced
- Topping :
    - 150 g slices of butter
- Optional: 
    - 1 apple, thinely sliced (Granny Smith or similar works nicely) *it is a variation, mostly done in one of the village of the valley, I usually don't bother*.
    - 1cl of dry white wine (Because Valais, it would be a Chasselas, called *Fendant* here) *I do recommend this one though*

### Recipe
- Sweet pastry dough:
    1. Sieve the flour into a bowl, make a crater in the centre and pour in the yeast mixed with a little warm milk.
    1. Pour in the rest of the warm milk along with the egg, sugar, softened butter, salt and lemon zest.
    1. Knead until the dough is even. (hand kneading is fun, but a stand mixer with a dough hook works well and is a lot less messy)
    1. Roll out the dough until it has a smooth, elastic consistency. Place in a lightly oiled bowl.
    1. Cover with a damp cloth and allow to rise at room temperature for about 2 hours. The dough should double in volume.

- Shortbread:
    - Mix the flour, sugar and cinnamon. Fold in the diced butter and knead until it has a sandy texture.
- Preparation

    1. Roll out the dough and place in a lightly oiled flan tin (or use parchment paper)
    1. Poke the dough with your finger or prick it with a fork.
        - if you want to cover the dough with the apple slice now.
    1. Spread the shortbread dough on the sweet pastry dough, press down the edges and smooth the surface.
    1. Place the slices of butter on top and bake in the oven for 45 minutes at 180° C.
        - If using the wine, after 30 minutes of baking, sprinkle the surface with it and put back in the oven. *If there's some left over wine, cheers*
    1. Remove, allow to cool, remove from the baking tin and place on a rack.

Serve warm or cold.
