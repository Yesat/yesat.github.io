# Quick spot where I just throw in my ideas

Thanks for showing interest, I'm still not entirely sure how far it will go but I'm putting here my wall of thoughts.

## Game context
I will be upfront plans are everything but nailed down. I kinda want to challenge myself a bit with the setting, so I am open from suggestions. While I will most likely make the decision, player input and contributions are welcome.  
It will be a single party campaign, not a West March or a shared universe.
- Some setting ideas:
    - Classic:  
    Relatively sparce setellements and cities, sprawling nature and wilderness but options for urban/village situations
    - Wild lands:  
    Barely any civilisation, more exploration, more wilderness, potentially hexcrawl.
    - Fallen empire:  
    Ruins, Old settlement, Forgotten ressources (I have been playing/watching a lot of Horizon Zero Dawn recently ðŸ˜Š)
    - Naval
    I shall research ship combat for that; a campaign centered around a ship and exploration from it.
    - "Modern"  
    Eberron/Final Fantasy style, technology and magic have been weaved and provided relatively clear advancements in infrastructure/comfort. But the wilderness.
    - And if you have any idea, please share when we'll do discussion
- Themes  
Classic adventures, heroes quests, more political stuff,... I'll say the less standard adventurers we stray the less simple it will be for me, but I'm open for it.

Overall goal would be going over to up to around level 10. I'm tempted to do a small-ish session for level 1 and 2, simple missions just to get to know each others with fast level up, but that will be discussed pre game.
 
## Logistic
Because I'm a nerd and a good part of the reason I like DM'ing is the toys I get to play with.
- Games on Saturday evening EU, frequency would be hopefully bi-weekly.
- Game will happen between Discord and FoundryVTT
- I'd love to stream/record it, not to become famous or get viewers, but to have a trace and place I can go back to it. Details are open to discussion. And also the fun of setting it up.
- Camera are welcome, but not mandatory. I will normally use it, but it is not needed. And camera will not be used on the feed. Microphone should be the norm, but 
- I wish to delegate the "scheduling" to the players to share the burden.
- Most likely 2 pre game session. Minus 1 for setting discussion/broad ideas and then session 0 to work on characters and exact details.

## Other points
I will try to care for you and hope you'll have a good experience, because I don't want to it to be worse than no DnD for anyone. I will try to discuss comfort and safety, both in session and out of it. And we'll all share the different moderation tools in the Discord. But at the same time, I'm only human, so don't feel scared to tell me if there's something I'm not doing wrong or there's another issue.
